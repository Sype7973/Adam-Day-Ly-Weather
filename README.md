# Adam-Day-Ly-Weather
##Description


- I wanted to create a minimalistic weather search that gives you the ability to find out today's weather and the next 5 days
- I built this project to utilise the API skills I learnt for module 6.  I wanted to test how an Ajax pull could be used to better understand the 'method' syntax
- It allows the user to search any city on the Openweathermap API database and gives an easy to understand set of weather conditions 
- I learn't that many functions can become redundant if you do not write carefully around your fetch, adding a live server makes things more difficult to process but alongside my group project - I understood this assignment a lot better!


## Installation

You the Github Pages url: https://sype7973.github.io/Adam-Day-Ly-Weather/ to open the weather Application. once there, enter a city into the search bar on the left and click the search button. Your 5 Day weather forecast will be available. The search will also create a button that saves your last search!

## Usage
